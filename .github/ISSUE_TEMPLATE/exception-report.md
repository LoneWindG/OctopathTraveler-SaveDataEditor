**Describe the problem**
If the "Program Exception" did not occur when you opened the save data file, please specify which items and what modifications were made that caused the problem.

**Exception Log File or Screenshots**
Please upload your exception log file (this file will be generated in the program execution directory when an exception occurs, and its file name is exception.log) so that I can find the code location where the exception occurred.
If the file does not exist, you can provide a screenshot of the "Program Exception" window, or paste the exception log (it will be automatically copied to the clipboard when the "Program Exception" window is displayed).

**Your SaveData File**
If possible, please upload your game save data file so I can use it for testing. Using a save data file that causes program errors will allow me to directly verify whether the problem has been fixed.
